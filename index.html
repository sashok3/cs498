<h1>Tuberculosis burden by region</h1>

<h2>Overview: </h2>
  <p style="font-size:120%;">This visualization is an interactive slideshow that focuses on analyzing prevalence of Tuberculosis across regions in the world.
    Tuberculosis is one of the <b>top 10</b> causes of death worldwide. Every year, a predominant part of the world population succumbs to the disease.  
    Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 for the year 2030). 
    This visualization begins by looking at the trend in population growth across regions followed by an analysis of the TB death count as well as the trend in number of incident cases across regions over a period of time.
